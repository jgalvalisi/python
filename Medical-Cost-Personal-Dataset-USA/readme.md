# Medical Cost Personal in the US

This Data is used in the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz; which is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book. The following data obtained from Kaggle, explain the cost of a small sample of the USA population's Medical Insurance Cost based on some attributes.

## Objective

To find which variables have the highest implication when establishing medical cost insurance of the people in the USA doing Machine Learning techniques (Linear Regression and KMeans Clustering).

## Data

The dataset is in the public domain and explains the cost of a small sample of the USA population's Medical Cost Personal based on different attributes.
